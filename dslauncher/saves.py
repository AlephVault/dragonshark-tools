# domain name), which will typically be unique. Inside, the {app}
# will then be a name that will be unique inside the package base.
# As an example, let's consider the base "com.mycompany.play" (it
# might come from play.mycompany.com actually) and the app name as
# simple as "MyGame". The final location for the game's saves will
